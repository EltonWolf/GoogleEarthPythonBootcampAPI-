# GoogleEarthPythonBootcampAPI-

I embarked on my first journey to deepen my understanding of geospatial data science, remote sensing, and cloud computing by enrolling in a comprehensive course. I  delved into the practical applications of these concepts using the Google Earth Engine Python API and Google Colab. The culmination of my exploration is presented in this repository, which houses a collection of meticulously crafted notebooks. These notebooks encapsulate the diverse range of projects, exercises, and experiments I undertook during the learning process. Each notebook serves as a tangible representation of my hands-on experience, showcasing the integration of geospatial data, the utilization of remote sensing techniques, and the seamless synergy with cloud computing resources. Explore these notebooks to gain insights into my journey of mastering geospatial data science and leveraging cutting-edge technologies to unravel the intricacies of our dynamic Earth.
